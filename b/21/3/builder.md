# What is GNOME Builder?
GNOME Builder, or just Builder, is an IDE (intergrated development environment) for Linux and other Unix-y OSes, that specialises in the field of GTK development. It is a great platform for begginners and pros alike to make nice apps, and unlike many of its alternatives has a lot of features to save you time.

# What am I comparing this to?
I used to use Visual Studio for programming back in my Windows days. It did what I needed it to, but it was complicating to use and very s       l      o     w. Then, when I transferred to Linux (a move I don't regret), I used VS Code with C# for a while, but it doesn't work great with Linux, and my options for graphical apps were very limited. Then when I switched from Ubuntu to Arch Linux in December, I decided to try out Qt Creator.
