# linux_kettle
I like Linux, programming, tinkering, and tinkering with programming on Linux.

## More about me
I made a game called Kettle3D, it's bad and doesn't work, but it's on GitHub and it's a good time capsule from my
Windows days. I now use Arch Linux, and program with GTK and am notoriously bad at putting my stuff on GitHub.

## What goes here
This will be filled with blog about tinkering with linux and programiming, but that's not ready just yet. Stay tuned!
