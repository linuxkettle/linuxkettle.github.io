## About me
I made a game called Kettle3D, it's bad and doesn't work, but it's on GitHub and it's a good time capsule from my
Windows days. I've been using Linux for nearly a year now, and recently switched from Arch to Fedora. I like to program with GTK and am notoriously bad at putting my stuff on GitHub.
