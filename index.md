## About me
I use helloSystem, an alpha-level FreeBSD distribution that aims to bring back the simplicities of '80s and '90s computing, in weird and wonderful ways. Without listening to this:
> hello is currently being developed. It is not yet available for general use

I installed it in a heartbeat. I have not regretted it since. And I would not recommend anybody else do the same until it's ready. VM is fine, but the installer will overwrite your hard drive and can't yet install to a USB.
